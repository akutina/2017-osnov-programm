Here I look at the verbs that can form so called Russian serial verb constructions (one verb can be only at first position, other - only on the second).
If there is a comma between those verbs - I delete it.
There are three parts in the code:
1) working with the str of sentences  ;
2) function taking one sentence as the argument  ;
3) working with big text and dictionaries (first verbs/second verbs)
